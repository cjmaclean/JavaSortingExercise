 * Question 3 â€“ You are required to make a list of different annual salaries for
 * payroll in whole numbers (integers) that will then need to be sorted, you
 * should have alternate methods of sorting so that payroll can decide on which
 * method they would like to use. You need to create an application that creates
 * lists of integers between 1 and 10 million. Your application must have the
 * ability to sort in three different styles with timers to indicate the speed
 * at which this happens you must have at least 100,000 items in your list as
 * this the future business strategy to employ at least this many staff. The
 * current system is only able to handle 12 staff. Only 1 sorting technique may
 * use the inbuilt sorting the rest you must write yourself. In addition, you
 * must list the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm. Your sorting
 * algorithm must have a comparator
